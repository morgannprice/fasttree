<H2>Fast Tree-Comparison Tools</H2>

<P>Comparing tree topologies is an essential and time-consuming step
in phylogenetic analysis.
<B>CompareTree.pl</B> and <B>CompareToBootstrap.pl</B>
are up to 100 times faster than the standard tools for comparing large trees.
For example, to compute the global bootstrap
for 100 replicates on a tree of 52,000 sequences, phylip's
<A HREF="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/doc/consense.html">consense</A>
took 118 hours and 9.4 GB
of RAM, while CompareToBootstrap.pl took just 80 minutes and 720 MB of RAM.
To compare two trees of
52,000 sequences took CompareTree.pl just 21 seconds, while phylip's
<A HREF="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/doc/treedist.html">treedist</A>
took 3 minutes to compare two trees of just 5,000 sequences.</P>

<P>The key trick is to hash the splits of a tree (the two lists of
nodes on either side of an internal edge) in just O(N) time by setting
the hash value for an internal node to the sum of its childrens' hash
values. We rely on the tree itself to store the list of
descendents, so that the hash requires only O(N) space.  Thus,
CompareTree.pl and CompareToBootstrap.pl require just O(N) space and
have a best-case running time of just O(N).  In contrast, most tools
require at least O(N<sup>2</sup>) time and space to compare two
trees.</P>

<P><B>CompareTree.pl</B> compares the splits in one tree to those in
another. In particular, it reports the fraction of splits in the 1st
tree that are also found in the second tree. This is related to the
"symmetric" or Robinson-Foulds distance by <i>fraction = 1 -
d/(2*(N<sub>leaves</sub>-3)).</i> CompareTree also reports the splits that line up and
compares their branch lengths and support values.</P>

<P><B>CompareToBootstrap.pl</B> counts how often the splits in a main tree are found in the resampled trees.
The bootstrap value for an internal node is the fraction of times that this split
(that is, the leaves beneath this node versus all other leaves) is
maintained in the resampled trees. CompareToBoostrap.pl outputs a new tree with the same topology and branch lengths as the original tree, but with these new bootstrap values. (Note: this is rather different from what
<A HREF="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/doc/consense.html">consense</A>
does -- consense computes a new majority-consensus topology and returns the number of trees that support each split as the branch length for that internal node.)</P>

<H3>Running the tree comparison scripts</H3>
  
<P>The tree-comparison tools are written in Perl and
should run on any platform with Perl installed. (We use version
5.32.1.) These tools rely on the <A HREF="MOTree.pm">MOTree.pm</A> Perl module, which is
included in this repository.

<P>Usage:
  <pre>
    CompareToBootstrap.pl -tree main_tree -boot bootstrapped_trees > new_tree
    CompareToBootstrap main_tree bootstrapped_trees > new_tree
    CompareTree.pl -tree tree1 -versus tree2 > comparison_table
  </pre>

<P>All input files must be in Newick format.

<P>CompareToBootstrap.pl will compare the main tree to the bootstrapped
trees. The bootstrapped tree file should contain multiple trees
separated by newlines and ending with a semicolon (";"), as is
standard for Newick format. (Each tree may be split across multiple
lines.) CompareToBootstrap.pl will print out a tree with the same
topology and branch lengths as the main tree and with bootstrap values
as the names for the internal nodes. The bootstrap values are
fractions, not counts.  In other words, they range from 0 to 1, not
from 0 to number of bootstraps.

<P>CompareTree.pl will compare two trees that describe the same set of
leaves. It reports to standard error a line on how similar the trees
are. Frac is the fraction of splits in the first tree that are found
in the second tree, MaxLnDf is the maximum difference in branch
lengths, and MaxBtDf is the maximum difference in bootstrap values.

<P>CompareTree.pl also prints out a tab-delimited table with one line per
internal node in the first tree. You will probably want to save this
to a file. Each line reports the branch length to its ancestor, its
bootstrap value (if any), the number of descendents, the values for
the corresponding split in the second tree (if this split exists in
the second tree), and two descendents of the split such that the least
common ancestor of these descendents is this node.  It also reports
the MOTree internal identifiers of the nodes as Node1 (and also Node2
if there is a matching node in the second tree).  These are useful if
you want to use MOTree::(new => $newickstring) to parse and further
analyze these trees.

<P>You can also run CompareTree.pl on files that contain more than one
tree. It will compare 1st tree in each file, the 2nd tree in each
file, etc.

<P>Both tools handle multifurcating trees, e.g., if comparing
(((A,B),C),D,E,F);
to
((A,B,C),D,E,F);
then the split ABC|DEF matches but the split AB|CDEF does not.

<P>The tree-comparison tools were developed by <A HREF="http://morgannprice.org">Morgan N. Price</A> in Adam Arkin's group at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
